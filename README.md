# Machine-learning-classification.-Rock-vs-Mines-Sonar-Dataset-
The aim of this project is to build a machine leraning model that can predict between rock and mines from sonar data.
Sonar (sound navigation and ranging) is a technique that uses sound propagation (usually underwater, as in submarine navigation) to navigate, 
measure distances (ranging), communicate with or detect objects on or under the surface of the water, such as other vessels.
